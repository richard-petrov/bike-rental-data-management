# ðŸš²Bike rental data management

A bike rental company requires a database to analyze the impact of weather conditions on bike rentals. The project involves using a yearâ€™s worth of bike rental data provided by the company and sourcing weather data from government databases. The tasks include cleaning and validating both datasets, designing a relational PostgreSQL database to store the information, and creating database views to support the analytics team in their analysis.

### Project objectives:

- Explore, Clean, and Transform Datasets: Analyze and preprocess the bike rental and weather data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

- Design and Implement a Relational PostgreSQL Database: Create a structured PostgreSQL database to efficiently store and manage the cleaned datasets.

- Use SQL to Develop Analytics-Ready Database Views: Develop SQL queries to generate views that facilitate effective analysis of the relationship between weather conditions and bike rentals.
